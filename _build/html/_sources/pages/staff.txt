Staff Check Gift Card
=====================

You may want to allow some people in your company (staff) to check for gift card information without giving them access to your Joomla!'s back-end.

To do this, you need to create Joomla! user accounts for your staff members, add these Joomla! users to the user group which you have selected for "Staff's User Group" option in CM Gift Card's configuration.

Create a new menu item with "Check Gift Cards" menu item type.

In your front-end, if you access this new menu item as a regular user (the one who is not in Staff group), you will receive error:

If you log in as a staff member, you can see all the gift cards and filter for the gift card you want to check the information.
